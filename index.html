                      <h3>Italian</h3>
                        <p>
                            Italian food is delicious. Who doesn't love pizza and pasta? One day I would love to go to Italy and try real Italian food.

                        <h3>Asian</h3>
                        <p>Asian food is also delicious! I especially enjoy chinese food. Korean food is also at the top of my list of favorite Asian cuisine. I first was introduced to Korean food when i was a teenager taking Tae Kwon Do. My master was from South Korean and on many occasion we got to eat food prepared by true Koreans.</p>

                        <h3>Mexican</h3>
                        <p>
                            I like all Mexican food. Americanized, authentic. It doesnt matter it is all good. When my husband was a teenager he got to go to Mexico and stay in a ville with the locals while he and his group helped build a school. He always talks about how great the food was and how amazing it was to watch them prepare it. I would love to have the same opportunity one day.

                        <h3>American</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hamburgers, hotdogs, apple pie. What kind of American would i be if I didn't love our cuisine? Other cuisines are great but there is nothing like the comfort of the food from my home country.
